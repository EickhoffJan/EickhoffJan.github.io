      Let a ring in the following text be defined as a commutative ring with unity.
      <h2>Question</h2>
      <p>Let \( R \subseteq S \) be rings. Then, if \( R \) is Noetherian as an \( S \)-module, is \( R \) also Noetherian as an \( R \)-module?
      </p>
      <p>At first glance one might expect “yes,” but the following counterexample shows that, in complete generality, the answer is <em>no</em>.</p>

      <h3>Counterexample</h3>
      <p>Let \(K\) be a field,</p>
      <p>
        \[
          R = K[x_1,x_2,\dots], 
          \quad 
          S = \text{End}_K(R),
        \]
      </p>
      <p>and embed \(R\) into \(S\) via</p>
      <p>
        \[
          \iota\colon R \; \hookrightarrow \; S,
          \quad
          r \;\mapsto\; \phi_r,
        \]
      </p>
      <p>where \(\phi_r\) is the endomorphism \(x\mapsto r\,x\).  We view \(R\) as an \(S\)-module by</p>
      <p>
        \[
          f\cdot x \;=\; f(x),
          \quad
          f\in S,\ x\in R.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> the usual multiplication in \(R\).</p>
      <p>Let \(x \in R\) be nonzero.  Then
          \[
            S\cdot x = \{\,f(x)\mid f\in S\}\subseteq R.
          \]
          Given any \(y\in R\), extend \(x\) to a \(K\)-basis \(B\) of the vector space \(R\).  Define a \(K\)-linear map
          \[
            f\colon R\to R,\quad f(x)=y,\quad f(b)=0\ \text{for }b\in B\setminus\{x\}.
          \]
          This map is well-defined, linear, and extends uniquely to \( R \).
          Hence \(f\in S\) and \(f(x)=y\).  Hence \(S\cdot x=R\).
      </p>
      <p>Thus every nonzero element generates the entire \(S\)-module, 
        so \(R\) is simple – and hence Noetherian – as an \(S\)-module.  
        On the other hand, \(R=K[x_1,x_2,\dots]\) is not Noetherian as a ring, 
        and therefore not Noetherian as an \(R\)-module.</p>

      <h2>The General Factorization Case</h2>
      <p>We now impose that the \(S\)-action on \(R\) factors through \(R\) itself.</p>

      <div class="theorem">
        <h3>Theorem (General Factorization)</h3>
        <p>Let \( R \subseteq S \) be rings, and suppose that \( R \) carries the structure of an 
          \( S \)-module, where the \( S \)-action factors through \( R \). Then every \( R \)-submodule of \( R \) 
          is already an \( S \)-submodule.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="proof">
        <h4>Proof.</h4>
        <p>
          Consider the ring homomorphism \( \varphi : S \to R \) through which the \( S \)-action on \( R \) is defined. Accordingly, for all \( s \in S \) and \( r \in R \), we have
          \[
          s \cdot r = \varphi(s) \cdot r.
          \]
          Let \( M \subseteq R \) be an \( R \)-submodule. Then the \( S \)-action on \( M \) satisfies
          \[
          S \cdot M = \varphi(S) \cdot M \subseteq R \cdot M \subseteq M.
          \]
          Hence, \( M \) is closed under the \( S \)-action and thus constitutes an \( S \)-submodule of \( R \).

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="corollary">
        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>Under the hypotheses of the General Factorization Theorem, if \(R\) is Noetherian as an \(S\)-module, then \(R\) is Noetherian as an \(R\)-module.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Surjective Case</h2>
      <p>Next, we consider the situation where \(R\) is a quotient of \(S\).</p>

      <div class="theorem">
        <h3>Theorem (Surjective Case)</h3>
        <p>
          Let \( R \subseteq S \) be rings, and let \( I \subseteq S \) be an ideal such that
          \[
          R \cong S/I.
          \]
          In particular, \( R \) acquires the natural structure of an \( S \)-module. 
          Under this identification, the \( S \)-submodules and \( R \)-submodules of \( R \) coincide.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="proof">
        <h4>Proof.</h4>
        <p>
          Consider the canonical surjective ring homomorphism \( \pi : S \to S/I \) through which the action of \( S \) on \( R \) is defined. Then, for all \( s \in S \) and \( r \in R \), the following holds:
          \[
          s \cdot r = \pi(s) \cdot r.
          \]
          Let \( N \subseteq R \) be an \( S \)-submodule of \( R \). Then,
          \[
          R \cdot N = \pi(S) \cdot N = S \cdot N \subseteq N.
          \]
          Thus, \( N \) is stable under the \( R \)-action, implying that \( N \) is also an \( R \)-submodule of \( R \). In view of the General Factorization Theorem, it follows that the \( S \)- and \( R \)-submodule structures on \( R \) are identical.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="corollary">
        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>Under the hypotheses of the Surjective Case, \(R\) is Noetherian as an \(S\)-module if and only if \(R\) is Noetherian as an \(R\)-module.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>Let \(R\) be any ring.  Consider the evaluation homomorphism</p>
      <p>
        \[
          \varphi\colon R[x]\to R,\quad f(x)\mapsto f(0).
        \]
      </p>
      <p>Then \(R\) becomes an \(R[x]\)-module by \(f\cdot r = f(0)\,r\).  Since \(R\cong R[x]/(x)\), this falls under the Surjective Case, and one sees immediately that \(R\) is Noetherian as an \(R[x]\)-module exactly when it is Noetherian as a ring.</p>
