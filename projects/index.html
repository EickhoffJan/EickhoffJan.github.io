      <h2>Seminars</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Homoclinic Points and Period Doubling </strong> Chaotic dynamics, TUM (Apr 2023)<br>
          <i>
            An introduction to homoclinic points and their connection to chaotic 
            dynamics – defining the concept, exploring their link to homoclinic orbits, 
            and highlighting their role in the emergence of chaos.
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Classification of Isometries in the Euclidean Plane</strong> Geometry and Groups,  Hurwitz Seminar - TUM (Sep 2024)<br>
          <i>
            A concise overview of all distance‐preserving maps in the plane – translations, rotations, reflections and glide 
            reflections – showing each arises from at most three reflections and forming 
            the foundation for higher‐dimensional generalizations.
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rational Functions on Plane Curves</strong> Algebraic Curves, TUM (Jun 2025)<br>
          <i>
            The field of rational functions on projective plane curves over an algebraically 
            closed field was investigated, including the reconstruction of the one‑variable 
            function field, its realization in the projective plane, decomposition into components
            and birational classification.

        <li>
          <strong>TBA</strong> Category Theory by Examples, TUM (Oct 2026)<br>
          <i>
            The seminar is ongoing.

      <h2>Honors & Awards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Winning Team - Reply Challenge at TUM.ai Makeathon 2024</strong>, TUM<br>
          <i>
            My team won the Reply Challenge at the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024, making us one 
            of four winning teams – each selected for the best solution in a specific 
            challenge track. Our project involved an AI-based solution to a real-world business problem.

      <h2>Volunteer Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Semester Representative</strong>, TUM (Oct 2022 - Oct 2023)<br>
          <i>
            As a Semester Representative, I played a role in 
            facilitating communication between students and the university 
            to improve the overall learning experience. I supported my fellow 
            students by addressing their concerns and serving as a bridge between 
            them and the faculty to ensure their voices were heard.
